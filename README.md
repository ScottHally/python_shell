# python_shell
Small shell using python

-- Features --
  - So far just a very barebones shell. The core of the project ideation was wanting to implement my own FTP client on the command line.
  - Supports commands (currently):
      - ls, lls (when connected to an FTP server), get, put
      - Also quit to exit the program and connect to initialize a connection to a remote server
      
  - Plans to implement most of the basic commands that many users would use (cd, mkdir, chmod, pwd, rm, etc.)
  
  
  It's nothing groundbreaking, just spending my time playing with python libraries mostly.
